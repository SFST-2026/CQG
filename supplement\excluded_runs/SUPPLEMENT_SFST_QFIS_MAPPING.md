# Supplement — SFST/QFIS mapping σ ↔ (g, Γ) and interpretative status

This supplement section supports the *interpretative* SFST/QFIS paragraph in the Executive Summary.

## Interpretative hypothesis (non-derivational status)
SFST/QFIS is used here as an **organizing interpretation**: it suggests a microscopic picture in which inertia
emerges from a finite-capacity vacuum “update rate” and a saturation susceptibility χ.
The EFT/TOV results in this repository **do not depend** on the truth of SFST/QFIS; all headline statements are phrased
in terms of the regulator scan parameters (σ, χ) and the diagnostics (epsratio, δ_total, convergence checks).

## Mapping convention
We parameterize the insertion as m_vac = σ χ (in repository units). A microscopic mapping can be written schematically as

- σ ↔ g_eff  (effective coupling strength of accelerated excitations to vacuum modes)
- χ ↔ χ(Γ)   (susceptibility as a function of a local flux/update rate Γ)

The supplement provides the mapping as a *dictionary* rather than a derivation, because multiple microscopic realizations
can generate the same low-energy insertion structure.

## Connection to microscopic topologies (Ambjørn–Watabiki spirit)
Discrete/triangulated vacuum substrates and their scaling dimensions motivate the language of finite update-rate and
fractal/scale-dependent structure. We cite representative work in the Ambjørn–Watabiki line in the bibliography file.

## What reviewers can verify in this snapshot
- The SFST/QFIS paragraph is clearly labeled interpretative.
- The quantitative results remain anchored to σ-scans and the stored CSV artefacts.
- Any SFST/QFIS-specific claims are confined to this supplement and are not used as headline evidence.
