# Interpretive remarks and broader implications (deferred)

This note collects **speculative / interpretive** viewpoints that motivated the SFST/QFIS modelling choices but are **not required** to follow, reproduce, or evaluate the neutron-star / GW-target results in the main paper.

## Scope statement

- The main manuscript is intentionally scoped to a **controlled EFT insertion** (Variant A) and its measurable consequences for compact-star observables (e.g., \(M\! -\! R\) and \(\Lambda(M)\)).
- The remarks below are **exploratory**. They are provided for completeness and to clarify long-term research directions, and should be read as hypotheses for follow-up work rather than as conclusions established by this paper.

## Working hypotheses (non-exhaustive)

1. **Inertial mass as an emergent response.** In the SFST picture, inertia can be interpreted as a medium response of vacuum degrees of freedom, captured phenomenologically by a susceptibility \(\chi\) and coupling \(\sigma\).

2. **Emergent spacetime / fluid analogy.** The effective SFST equations may be viewed as a hydrodynamic limit of an underlying emergent spacetime substrate. This analogy is used as intuition only; the present paper does not depend on committing to any specific microscopic model.

3. **Compact-object saturation motifs.** In the high-density regime, saturation-like behaviour (QFIS) can be used as a regulator that avoids unphysical divergences in effective descriptions. Any statements about black-hole interiors or singularity resolution are deferred to separate work.

## Follow-up work

A dedicated follow-up manuscript is planned to address these broader implications in a focused way, including (i) a more explicit mapping to emergent spacetime frameworks and (ii) a systematic discussion of compact-object saturation scenarios beyond the neutron-star structure problem.
