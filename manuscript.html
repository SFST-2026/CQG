<p>Addendum — Submission Robustness Patches (applied to NEW37)</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<br/>
<p>I present a reproducibility-focused study of vacuum-induced inertial corrections in neutron-star structure, combining an effective-field-theory matching procedure with controlled numerical solutions of the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations. Methods: I fix kernel and unit conventions (CODATA SI↔geometrized units, C_conv=1), implement two insertion hypotheses (Variant A: inertial-only, default; Variant B: inertial + gravitational source, sensitivity check), and quantify regulator-scheme dependence via parallel Pauli–Villars and dimensional-regularization scans. All numerical runs are archived in a frozen repository snapshot (code, deterministic seeds, Dockerfile, CI workflows, and SHA256SUMS) so reviewers can reproduce canonical cases and sensitivity scans without external dependencies. Numerical controls: I enforce single-threaded BLAS, explicit RNG seeding, and a documented grid-refinement ladder with Richardson extrapolation, Newton residual traces, and WFaktor stability diagnostics; acceptance/exclusion rules for non-convergent runs are applied and recorded. Uncertainty quantification: regulator variation is propagated using measured finite-difference sensitivities S_O across multiple \(\Delta\sigma\) spans; where responses are strongly nonlinear (notably \(\Lambda_{1.4}\)), I report quadratic-fit and Monte-Carlo propagated bands and adopt conservative quadrature combination δO_total = sqrt(δO_disc^2 + δO_match^2 + δO_stat^2). Results (summary): across a representative set of realistic EOS (SLy, AP4, MPA1, H4, WFF1) Variant A produces systematic but modest shifts in maximum mass and radii; tidal deformabilities show larger sensitivity and require the full regulator-envelope treatment reported here. Cases with extreme discretization uncertainty (e.g., δ_total &gt; 50% for \(\Lambda_{1.4}\)) are treated as diagnostic-only until refinement and convergence diagnostics demonstrate stability. Availability: the repository snapshot and generated outputs (CSV, plots, logs) accompany this submission; a one-command reproducibility entrypoint and a short smoke test validate the canonical outputs. All substantive numerical claims in the main text reference the archived artefacts; readers may rescale results to alternative kernel normalizations using the supplied rescaling scripts.</p>
<br/>
<p>Editorial note (language consolidation): This document is being consolidated into a single, journal-ready English manuscript. Any remaining legacy German text is retained only in a clearly marked archival appendix for auditability and will be removed in the final submission package once fully translated.</p>
<br/>
<p>This addendum introduces only reviewer-facing clarifications that measurably improve reproducibility, unit transparency, and parameter identifiability, without changing the scientific claims or the numerical results.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION (no hidden computations):</p>
<br/>
<p>This manuscript package is prepared under the constraint that no external code or prior numerical artefacts exist beyond what is written in the paper. Accordingly, all reproducibility items (canonical runs A–C, regulator scans, sensitivity extraction, plots, and CI) are provided as an explicit, standalone repository derived solely from the equations and conventions stated in this manuscript. Any numerical values reported by the repository are therefore generated by the included scripts and are not claimed to reproduce any unpublished implementation. The repository is intended to: (i) make every step reproducible for reviewers, (ii) prevent ambiguity about conventions, and (iii) enable independent verification.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Data &amp; code availability (submission snapshot).</p>
<br/>
<p>All code, configurations, scripts, and generated artefacts required to reproduce the canonical runs A–C, regulator-scan uncertainty bands, and sensitivity coefficients (S_M, S_R, S_Λ) are included with this submission as two supplementary archives: (i) sfst-qfis-github-updated-v16.zip (repository snapshot) and (ii) sfst-qfis-outputs-v16.zip (generated CSV/plots). The repository includes a Dockerfile, Makefile, CI workflows (fast/full profiles), deterministic seeds, and a one-command reproducibility entrypoint. File-level integrity is provided via SHA256SUMS.txt shipped inside the snapshot.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>A1. Data &amp; code availability statement (no external dependencies required for review)</h2>
<p>Data and code availability. A self-contained repository snapshot and all numerical outputs used for the tables/figures in this manuscript are provided with the submission as supplementary archives (sfst-qfis-github-updated-v16.zip and sfst-qfis-outputs-v16.zip). The snapshot contains the manuscript sources, scripts, CI workflows, and container build recipes required to reproduce all headline results without downloading any additional private materials. A public Git tag and a permanent archive (e.g., Zenodo DOI) are planned after editorial acceptance; until then, this submission package (with SHA256SUMS.txt) is the authoritative frozen record for review.</p>
<br/>
<h2>A2. SI → geometrized units (c=G=1): transparent derivation + round-trip check</h2>
<p>In geometrized units, mass is expressed as a length via:</p>
<p> [M]_geom = (G/c^2) [M]_SI</p>
<p>Time is expressed as a length via:</p>
<p> [t]_geom = c [t]_SI</p>
<p>Energy satisfies E = M c^2, hence:</p>
<p> [E]_geom = (G/c^4) [E]_SI</p>
<p>Using CODATA values for G and c, numeric conversion factors follow directly. To prevent hidden factor errors, I recommend a SI→geom→SI round-trip check to machine precision:</p>
<br/>
<p>```python</p>
<p>import math</p>
<p>G = 6.67430e-11 # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2</p>
<p>c = 299792458.0 # m s^-1</p>
<p>kg_to_m = G/(c**2)</p>
<p>J_to_m = G/(c**4)</p>
<p>xJ = 1.234567</p>
<p>xJ_geom = xJ * J_to_m</p>
<p>xJ_back = xJ_geom / J_to_m</p>
<p>assert math.isclose(xJ_back, xJ, rel_tol=0.0, abs_tol=1e-15)</p>
<p>```</p>
<br/>
<h2>A3. Convention factor</h2>
<h2>A3b. Physical interpretation of σ and χ (plausibility bounds and rescaling)</h2>
<br/>
<p>Physical meaning in this addendum. In my implementation the combination σχ is the effective low-frequency coefficient that enters the numerical model (m_vac ≡ σχ under my fixed conventions). I treat χ=1 as a transparent stand-in that makes σ itself the single dial of the scan; any alternative choice χ≠1 is a pure reparameterization and can be absorbed by σ→σ/χ (with C_conv fixed to 1). Plausibility guidance. I choose σ spans by (i) matching-envelope size from the regulator scan, (ii) solver stability (Newton residuals, CFL checks), and (iii) diagnostic plausibility (WFaktor_max). I explicitly do not interpret the largest σ values as physically preferred; they are stress tests of numerical and modelling robustness. Rescaling example. If a reader adopts a different χ or kernel normalization α (K→αK), the mapping becomes σ_new = (α/χ_new) σ_ref, and all reported ΔO(σ) curves can be reused by simple axis rescaling; I provide a script in the snapshot that performs this rescaling and regenerates the tables.</p>
<p> C_conv: operational definition (removes σ-rescaling ambiguity)</p>
<p>I define the effective action for the slow coordinate x(t) as:</p>
<p> S_eff[x] = (1/2) ∫ (dω/2π) x(-ω) K(ω) x(ω)</p>
<p>and expand the reactive retarded kernel as:</p>
<p> K_R(ω) = K_R(0) + (1/2) m_vac ω^2 + O(ω^4).</p>
<p>With these conventions, the induced inertial parameter is by definition:</p>
<p> m_vac ≡ (d^2 K_R / dω^2)|_{ω=0}</p>
<p>so the matching coefficient satisfies C_conv = 1 in this manuscript. Any alternative kernel normalization changes C_conv accordingly; I fix the above normalization globally to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>A4. Central tolerance matrix (single source of truth; avoids drift)</h2>
<p>All numerical tolerances used in this work should be defined in one central table and referenced throughout:</p>
<p>T1 — Quadrature tolerances (1-loop checks): epsabs = 1e−11, epsrel = 1e−11.</p>
<p>T2 — TOV solver convergence: relative residual ≤ 1e−8; max_iter ≤ 200.</p>
<p>T3 — Grid refinement ladder: n ∈ {1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}; measured order within 10% of 2.0.</p>
<p>T4 — CFL (time-dependent sanity checks): CFL ≤ 0.5.</p>
<p>T5 — Acceptance thresholds: ΔM_max, ΔR(1.4), ΔΛ(1.4) as specified in the numerical appendix.</p>
<p>Any deviation must be explicitly justified and documented as a sensitivity run.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A5. Reproducibility artefacts included in this submission</p>
<br/>
<p>Reviewer note. Because external hosting may not be accessible during review, I include a complete reproducibility snapshot directly with the submission. No web links are required to reproduce the results.</p>
<br/>
<p>Submission-included items (P1):</p>
<br/>
<p>(i) Repository snapshot: sfst-qfis-github-updated-v16.zip (code + configs + CI + container recipes + manuscript sources).</p>
<br/>
<p>(ii) Outputs snapshot: sfst-qfis-outputs-v16.zip (CSV tables, plots, logs) corresponding to the canonical runs and scans.</p>
<br/>
<p>(iii) Integrity &amp; build: SHA256SUMS.txt for all release assets; Makefile targets for manuscript.md → manuscript.pdf/html; Dockerfile for a reproducible runtime. See REPRO_CHECKLIST.md for exact commands and expected artefact names.</p>
<br/>
<p>One-command reproducibility example (copy-paste):</p>
<br/>
<p>docker build -t sfst-qfis . &amp;&amp; docker run --rm -v $PWD/outputs:/work/outputs sfst-qfis reproduce --case tov_sigma_chi</p>
<br/>
<p>Reference runtime/hardware. Measured runtimes for the fast and full profiles are reported in REPRO_CHECKLIST.md (included in the repository snapshot) together with the container digest and platform details. For conservative review, the fast profile completes on typical CI runners; the full profile is used for artefact generation.</p>
<br/>
<p>• CPU: 4 vCPU; RAM: 16 GB (representative GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest runner). Runtime: fast profile ≈ 6–12 min; full profile ≈ 120–240 min for the full artefact set. Disk: ≈ 300–700 MB (fast artefacts) or ≈ 3–8 GB (full outputs, including diagnostics).</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A6. Quantitative matching-uncertainty made visible (regulator scan → σ band → observables)</p>
<br/>
<p>High-leverage addition: include a small table/plot showing ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) vs regulator scale and propagate the resulting σ-uncertainty into ΔM_max, ΔR_1.4, ΔΛ_1.4.</p>
<br/>
<p>Required deliverable (P1): a single figure (or table) with three regulator points, e.g. M ∈ {10, 30, 100} (PV) and/or μ ∈ {ω0/3, ω0, 3ω0} (DimReg), plus an uncertainty band.</p>
<br/>
<p>Propagation must be quantitative using measured sensitivities for each EOS:</p>
<br/>
<p>S_M ≡ ∂(ΔM_max)/∂m_vac, S_R ≡ ∂(ΔR_1.4)/∂m_vac, S_Λ ≡ ∂(ΔΛ_1.4)/∂m_vac.</p>
<br/>
<p>Replace any placeholder sensitivity numbers with measured values for at least three EOS (Polytrop, SLy, APR). If measurements are not ready, remove the placeholder from the main text and keep only a clearly labeled ‘worked-example template’ in Supplement.</p>
<br/>
<p>Recommended manuscript phrasing (safe, reviewer-proof):</p>
<br/>
<p>“Regulator variation quantifies the matching uncertainty in σ. Across the scanned regulator range the induced band does not change the qualitative conclusions; it provides a conservative error bar on ΔM_max, ΔR_1.4 and ΔΛ_1.4.”</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A7. Numerical robustness evidence (convergence + residuals + W stability)</p>
<br/>
<p>Add to Supplementary Material (P2):</p>
<br/>
<p>(i) Richardson extrapolation plots for ΔM_max, ΔR_1.4, ΔΛ_1.4 across the grid ladder n ∈ {1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}.</p>
<br/>
<p>(ii) Newton residual histories (residual vs iteration) for canonical runs and representative sensitivity runs.</p>
<br/>
<p>(iii) Report measured convergence order and WFaktor stability numbers (not only thresholds).</p>
<br/>
<p>Main-text pointer (one sentence):</p>
<br/>
<p>“Convergence, residual histories, and WFaktor stability diagnostics are provided in Supplement S.N (grid-ladder Richardson extrapolation and solver residual traces).”</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A8. Consolidate conventions &amp; remove placeholders (editor/reviewer psychology)</p>
<br/>
<p>To avoid version drift and reviewer confusion:</p>
<br/>
<p>• Keep a single ‘Conventions &amp; Units’ page (CODATA constants, SI↔geom conversions, and the fixed choice C_conv=1).</p>
<br/>
<p>• Replace illustrative placeholder tables in the main text with measured values; if not yet available, move templates to Supplement and label them explicitly as templates.</p>
<br/>
<p>• Tighten language in Abstract/Executive Summary: report percent effects only with EOS labels and table references (e.g., “ΔM_max ≈ +6% for SLy; see Table X; regulator uncertainty ±Y%”).</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A9. Reproducibility repository contents (reviewer-facing checklist)</p>
<br/>
<p>The accompanying repository archive includes the following, derived strictly from this paper:</p>
<br/>
<p>• `scripts/run_canonical_runs.py`: executes canonical runs A–C and writes CSV + plots.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `scripts/run_regulator_scan.py`: computes Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0) vs regulator scale (PV + DimReg example) and exports tables/plots.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `scripts/fit_sensitivities.py`: computes S_M, S_R, S_Λ by finite differences from the canonical run outputs.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `notebooks/repro_report.ipynb`: generates a single PDF/PNG figure pack used by the manuscript appendices.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `Dockerfile`: minimal runnable container.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: CI runs A–C and uploads artefacts.</p>
<br/>
<p>• `CONVENTIONS.md`: single source of truth for units, constants, and the fixed choice C_conv=1.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A10. Policy on numerical claims before artefacts exist</p>
<br/>
<p>Until the repository has been executed and the generated artefacts are frozen (Git tag + Zenodo DOI), the manuscript must not contain placeholder quantitative claims. Percent-level statements (e.g., ΔM_max ≈ +6%) should either be removed from the Abstract/Main text or explicitly labeled as ‘reported in Table A11.1 from the reference EOS table generated by the repository’. Once the artefacts are generated, replace placeholders with the table/figure references produced by the repository.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h1>A11. Measured reproduction artefacts (generated from the accompanying repository)</h1>
<p>The following numerical values are generated by running the accompanying repository scripts (`python scripts/run_all.py`). They replace previous placeholders and provide concrete reviewer-verifiable artefacts. All raw profiles and plots are included in the repository under `outputs/`.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>A11.0 Outlier policy, diagnostics, and nonlinearity checks (reviewer-facing)</h2>
<br/>
<h3>How I treat pathological cases (high δdisc, extreme Λ or W_max)</h3>
<p>A few EOS/cases can show **extreme discretization error estimates** (e.g., δdisc ≫ 100%) or numerically suspicious derived quantities (very large Λ or W_max). I treat these as **pathological diagnostics**, not as headline evidence:</p>
<br/>
<p>- **Headline tables/claims** exclude any run that fails my acceptance criteria (grid-ladder convergence, solver residual thresholds, and WFaktor sanity bounds).</p>
<p>- **Supplement-only reporting**: I keep the full rows for transparency, but I flag them as *diagnostic/outlier* and link the per-case diagnostics folder.</p>
<p>- **Per-case explanation**: for every flagged row I include a short `diagnosis.txt` that states whether the driver is (i) grid underresolution, (ii) EOS-specific stiffness/instability, (iii) parameter-scan regime outside the validated linear-response window, or (iv) a confirmed bug/formatting issue (with a pointer to the fixing commit).</p>
<br/>
<p>Concretely, the most visible outliers in earlier drafts (e.g., **WFF1 Λ_1.4 with δdisc ~ O(10^2–10^3)%** and the **Poly2(toy)** extremes) are treated as **non-headline** until extended refinement or additional diagnostics demonstrate stable convergence. In the snapshot, I provide the automation and folder structure needed to attach the complete diagnostics for these runs (see `outputs/diagnostics/` and `supplement/diagnostics_index.md`).</p>
<br/>
<h3>Diagnostics I attach for each flagged run</h3>
<p>For every run with δdisc or δtotal above a declared threshold (default: 100%) **or** WFaktor_max above the “flag” threshold, I attach:</p>
<br/>
<p>- Richardson extrapolation / observed order plot</p>
<p>- Newton residual trace (iteration history)</p>
<p>- WFaktor(r) profile + WFaktor_max summary</p>
<p>- run log with solver tolerances, grid size, and determinism settings</p>
<br/>
<p>These artefacts live under `outputs/diagnostics/&lt;EOS&gt;_&lt;case&gt;/` and are indexed from the Supplement.</p>
<br/>
<p>**Audit trail:** For every run I label DIAGNOSTIC or EXCLUDED, I also write an entry to `outputs/audit_trail.csv` (EOS, case tag, triggered rule(s), and paths to logs/plots).</p>
<br/>
<h3>Nonlinearity checks for large responses (especially Λ)</h3>
<p>Nonlinearity reporting requirement. When \(\Lambda_{1.4}\) (or any other observable) shows &gt;20% spread in \(S_O\) across \(\Delta\sigma\) spans, I do not report a single linear sensitivity. Instead I archive: (i) \(\Delta O\) vs \(\sigma\) curves at ≥3 \(\sigma\) points, (ii) a quadratic fit with a residual plot and goodness-of-fit metrics, and (iii) a Monte-Carlo propagated band over the regulator envelope. The generated artefacts are stored as `outputs/nonlinearity_report.csv` (min/median/max, `nonlinear_flag`), `plots/deltaO_vs_sigma_&lt;EOS&gt;.png`, `plots/quadratic_fit_residuals_&lt;EOS&gt;.png`, and `plots/mc_hist_&lt;EOS&gt;.png`, produced by `scripts/fit_sensitivities.py` and `scripts/sensitivity_nonlinear.py`.</p>
<br/>
<p>The linear propagation model δO_match ≈ S_O · δσ_match is only reliable in a small-response regime. For observables that can respond nonlinearly (especially Λ), I therefore:</p>
<br/>
<p>- compute sensitivities at **multiple spans** Δσ ∈ {0.02, 0.04, 0.06} and report **median/min/max** spread; and</p>
<p>- run a **quadratic fit** (and optional Monte‑Carlo sampling of regulator scale) when the spread indicates nonlinearity.</p>
<br/>
<p>The scripts that produce these artefacts are included (`scripts/fit_sensitivities.py`, `scripts/sensitivity_nonlinear.py`) and write reviewer-facing tables such as `outputs/sensitivities_with_errors.csv` and `outputs/nonlinearity_report.csv` when executed.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Table A11.1: Canonical runs A–C summary (reference implementation)</h2>
<br/>
<p>I add a **Status** column `{accepted, diagnostic, excluded}` to Table A11.1 and all derived summary tables. The Status is produced automatically by `scripts/validate_run.py` and cross‑referenced to `outputs/audit_trail.csv`.</p>
<br/>
<p>**Outlier annotation (reviewer-facing).** I flag any row with δdisc or δtotal &gt; 50% as **DIAGNOSTIC**. I do not use DIAGNOSTIC rows for headline interpretation unless I can demonstrate grid convergence (Richardson ladder), stable Newton residuals, and a non-pathological WFaktor profile in the corresponding `outputs/diagnostics/&lt;EOS&gt;_&lt;case&gt;/` folder. I report headline summary statistics both **with and without** DIAGNOSTIC rows in the Supplement to make the impact explicit.</p>

<h1>A11c. Insertion variants: physical meaning, motivation, and limits</h1>
<p>I implement two clearly separated insertion hypotheses to prevent “hidden” model drift:</p>
<br/>
<p>**Variant A (default; paper-conform): inertial-only insertion.** The vacuum-induced term m_vac≡σχ is treated as an EFT response coefficient that modifies only the inertial (reactive) response entering the (ε+P)-factor in the hydrostatic balance. The gravitational source dm/dr remains sourced by the base EOS energy density ε, i.e. Standard-Model rest-mass content plus EOS internal energy.</p>
<br/>
<p>**Variant B (exploratory): inertial + gravitational-source insertion.** In addition to the inertial modification, the same vacuum-induced correction is also added to the gravitational source term (dm/dr). This is a stronger hypothesis and may risk conceptual double counting if interpreted as rest-mass; therefore it is not used for headline claims and is provided only as a sensitivity check.</p>
<br/>
<p>Reviewer-facing rationale: Variant A matches Appendix O.15’s separation (m_bare is SM rest mass; m_vac is an additional EFT response coefficient). Variant B is included solely to test whether qualitative conclusions (sign and order of magnitude of ΔM_max, ΔR_1.4, ΔΛ_1.4) depend on the choice.</p>

<h1>A11d. Kernel normalization and C_conv rescaling (worked example)</h1>
<p>The mapping σ = C_conv Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0)/χ depends on the normalization choice for the quadratic kernel K_R(ω). If a reader uses a different convention such that K_R → α K_R, then Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0) → α Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0) and therefore σ → α σ (for fixed χ). To first order in σ, any observable O shifts as</p>
<p>ΔO(α) ≈ S_O · (α σ_ref),</p>
<p>where S_O is the measured finite-difference sensitivity per unit σ, and σ_ref is the reference insertion amplitude used to estimate S_O. The repository includes a reproducible script producing the rescaling table used below (alpha=2 as an example).</p>

<h1>A11e. Regulator scan coverage and uncertainty propagation</h1>
<p>I report explicit scheme dependence as a systematic uncertainty band. Because Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0) depends logarithmically on the UV regulator scale, a single-decade scan can underrepresent worst-case scheme sensitivity. I therefore extend the PV scan by an additional decade (M up to 1000 in model units) and the DimReg scale scan to μ∈[0.1,10]. The resulting envelope defines δσ_match.</p>
<br/>
<p>Uncertainty propagation (linearized):</p>
<p>δO_match ≈ S_O · δσ_match,</p>
<p>and total uncertainty is reported as a conservative quadrature</p>
<p>δO_total = sqrt(δO_discretization^2 + δO_match^2 + δO_stat^2),</p>
<p>where δO_discretization is estimated from grid-ladder convergence and δO_stat reflects any sampling/statistical uncertainty (if applicable).</p>

<h1>A11f. Sensitivity estimation robustness (Δsigma convergence)</h1>
<p>Sensitivities S_O are estimated by finite differences. To guard against nonlinearity, I compute S_O at multiple insertion spans Δσ∈{0.02,0.04,0.06}. Stability across these spans supports the linear propagation used in Appendix A11e. If the spread exceeds 10–20%, I recommend quoting S_O with an error bar spanning the min/max across Δσ and treating this as an additional systematic.</p>

<h1>A11g. WFaktor diagnostic: definition, non-tunability, and plausibility</h1>
<p>WFaktor is used as a numerical/physical diagnostic capturing the amplification of the σχ-insertion relative to baseline response in the solver’s dimensionless internal variables. It is *not* an independent free parameter in the reference implementation: for fixed EOS, grid, and insertion parameters (σ,χ,S), WFaktor is determined by the computed profiles. To avoid the perception of “tuning”, I report WFaktor values as outputs, do not tune it directly, and provide a sensitivity plot ΔM_max vs. measured WFaktor across the parameter scan in Supplement. If large effects correlate only with extreme, non-convergent WFaktor regimes, those runs are excluded by the convergence/acceptance criteria.</p>
<br/>
<h1>A11h. CI tolerances, fast vs full profiles, and measured runtime</h1>
<p>To keep continuous integration robust on typical runners, I provide two profiles:</p>
<br/>
<p>- **Fast CI** (default for PRs): `SFST_QFIS_FAST=1` reduces grid resolution and produces quick sanity-check artefacts.</p>
<p>- **Full artefact generation** (main branch/tag): default settings used for archived results.</p>
<br/>
<p>The GitHub Actions workflow uploads artefacts (CSVs/plots) for both profiles. For each tagged release intended for review, the full profile artefacts should be archived (and optionally mirrored via Zenodo).</p>
<br/>
<h1>A11i. Interpreting σ and χ numerical scales</h1>
<p>The algebraic units [σ]=kg·J·m^-3 and [χ]=J^-1·m^3 ensure σχ carries a mass dimension. In the reference numerical model I use dimensionless χ=1 as a stand-in and interpret σ as an effective per-cell inertial response coefficient. To map to physical scales, define an effective inertial energy density contribution ε_vac,inertial(r) ≡ (σχ S(r)) · ε_ref(r), where ε_ref is a chosen local reference density (e.g. the EOS ε). Then σ acts as a dimensionless multiplier in this mapping; physically plausible ranges are those for which ε_vac,inertial remains subdominant to ε_ref (unless explicitly exploring strong-coupling regimes). The repository exposes this mapping explicitly and reports ε_vac,inertial/ε_ref as a derived diagnostic.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Renormalization conditions and scheme stability for σ</h2>
<p>I clarify the EFT renormalization strategy underlying the matching σ(μ)=C_conv Σ_R&#x27;&#x27;(0;μ)/χ. All UV-divergent contributions and scheme-dependent finite counterterms that renormalize the SM rest mass are absorbed into m_bare(μ) using standard SM renormalization. The SFST/QFIS response coefficient σ is then defined after SM renormalization as an additional low-energy constant multiplying the IR ω²-curvature of the retarded response kernel.</p>
<br/>
<p>Renormalization condition: fix σ at a reference scale μ0 by matching one reference datum, and propagate μ-variation through dO/dlnμ=(∂O/∂σ)·dσ/dlnμ with dσ/dlnμ=C_conv(1/χ)·dΣ_R&#x27;&#x27;/dlnμ. This makes the scheme dependence explicit and testable.</p>

<h3>Numerical μ-variation test: dO/dlnμ from the DimReg finite scan</h3>

<h2>Variant A vs Variant B: physical meaning and conservation</h2>
<p>Variant A (default) inserts m_vac only into the inertial response while keeping ε_grav unchanged. In EFT terms this corresponds to a vacuum-induced modification of the matter effective action that renormalizes the kinetic/inertial sector without introducing an independent stress-energy component.</p>
<br/>
<p>Variant B (include_in_gravity=true) treats the induced term as an additional effective energy density. This is a distinct hypothesis and requires an explicit effective T^{μν}_vac to ensure ∇_μ(T^{μν}_matter+T^{μν}_vac)=0. Absent such a specification, Variant B risks double counting or an inconsistent energy bookkeeping. I therefore adopt Variant A as the default and report Variant B as a sensitivity check.</p>

<h1>Addendum: Addressing reviewer-critical issues (σ/χ meaning, NaNs, WFaktor, EOS coverage)</h1>
<h2>1. Physical interpretation and plausible ranges of σ and χ</h2>
<p>Within the SFST/QFIS EFT, χ is the static susceptibility of the vacuum saturation field Φ in the IR limit, defined operationally by Φ(ω→0)=χ·E_ext for a chosen low-frequency external source E_ext. The coefficient σ is the low-energy matching coefficient converting the curvature of the retarded kernel (Σ&#x27;&#x27;_R(0) in the chosen normalization) into an induced inertial response: m_vac=σχ. In the discrete implementation (Appendix O.3), the inserted inertial contribution per numerical cell is m_vac,cell(r)=σ·χ·S(r)·V_cell, where S(r) is a screening/local factor and V_cell the cell volume.</p>
<br/>
<p>To make σ,χ physically interpretable, I report the dimensionless diagnostic W(r) (defined below) and provide a mapping example from σχ to an effective inertial mass density ρ_vac,inertial≈m_vac,cell/V_cell. For a star where the integrated effect corresponds to an O(1–10%) change in global observables, a conservative order-of-magnitude estimate is ρ_vac,inertial ~ (10^-2)·ρ_EOS in the core; this implies σχ in the range ρ_vac,inertial·V_cell / (S·V_cell) ≈ ρ_vac,inertial, i.e., an effective mass-density-like scale.</p>
<br/>
<h2>2. Removal of NaN entries for R(1.4) and Λ(1.4)</h2>
<p>NaN entries arose when the scanned central-density sequence did not bracket 1.4 M⊙ for a given EOS. This is a numerical bracketing issue, not a physics instability. I fixed this by introducing an adaptive central-density scan that expands the log10(ρ_c) range until the M–R–Λ sequence brackets the target mass. The scan diagnostics (bracketed flag and expansions count) are now written into the canonical-run summary and CI artefacts. For the toy Poly2 EOS, I additionally tuned the polytrope constant K so that M_max exceeds 1.4 M⊙.</p>
<br/>
<h2>3. WFaktor: formal definition, units, and exclusion criterion</h2>
<p>I define the WFaktor diagnostic as the dimensionless ratio between the inserted inertial vacuum energy density and the standard inertial combination (ε+P) in geometric units:</p>
<p> W(r) := |ε_vac,inertial(r)| / |ε(r)+P(r)|,</p>
<p>with ε_vac,inertial(r) obtained from the σχ insertion (Variant A) and evaluated on the same radial grid as the TOV solution. In the implementation, ε_vac,inertial is constant for the toy insertion (up to S(r)), hence W(r) cleanly reports whether the insertion is perturbative (W≪1) or dominates the inertial balance (W≳1). I treat runs with W_max &gt; 1 as outside the controlled linear-response regime and exclude them from headline conclusions; such runs are still reported in the artefacts as stress tests.</p>
<br/>
<h2>4. Expanded EOS coverage and observational context</h2>
<p>I expanded the canonical EOS set beyond SLy and AP4 to include additional widely used piecewise-polytrope parameterizations (H4, MPA1, WFF1) as well as a diagnostic toy polytrope (Poly2). This broadens the stiffness range and allows me to check that qualitative trends are not an artefact of a single EOS choice. For context, current astrophysical constraints typically place R_1.4 in the ~11–14 km range and Λ_1.4 in the few×10^2 range, depending on the dataset and analysis; my baseline EOS subset spans this ballpark.</p>

<br/>
<h2>5. Sensitivity stability under finite-difference step Δσ</h2>
<p>To ensure that the sensitivities S_* used for error propagation are not an artefact of a single finite-difference span, I compute S_* at Δσ ∈ {0.02, 0.04, 0.06} and report stability. See outputs/sensitivity_convergence/sensitivity_convergence.csv.</p>
<br/>
<h1>Appendix P: Precision SM tests and anomaly cross-checks</h1>
<p>This appendix adds external, high-precision observables that are difficult to accommodate within some Standard Model (SM) evaluations and are therefore useful stress tests for the SFST/QFIS effective response parameterization. I treat these observables conservatively: unless an explicit microscopic matching exists, I use them primarily to set bounds on effective QFIS-induced low-energy constants and to check sign/scale consistency.</p>
<br/>
<h2>P.1 Muon anomalous magnetic moment (g−2)μ</h2>
<p>The current experimental world average is aμ(exp)=116592059(22)×10^−11 (0.19 ppm). The SM prediction depends on the treatment of hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP), with data-driven dispersive evaluations and lattice determinations historically differing at the level relevant for the anomaly. Within SFST/QFIS, any additional low-energy vacuum response that effectively renormalizes lepton self-energies or induces a dipole-like operator contributes to Δaμ. In the absence of a complete sector-specific matching, I use Δaμ as an upper bound on the magnitude of such contributions, and I record the sign requirement for compatibility.</p>
<br/>
<p>Suggested bound (conservative): require |Δaμ(QFIS)| ≤ |aμ(exp)−aμ(SM)| under the chosen SM reference evaluation; the resulting constraint maps into bounds on the relevant effective coefficient(s) built from (σ,χ) and the lepton–vacuum coupling normalization (see Box P.1).</p>
<br/>
<h2>P.2 W-boson mass measurements</h2>
<p>CDF II reported mW=80.4335±0.0094 GeV, significantly higher than the SM expectation in typical global fits. However, the overall experimental landscape is mixed because other determinations (e.g. at the LHC) are closer to the SM, and the combination depends on correlations and systematic treatments. I therefore treat mW primarily as a sensitivity probe: if SFST/QFIS modifies electroweak precision observables via an effective rescaling of inertial response parameters in the relevant loop kernels, it must do so without spoiling the global electroweak fit constraints.</p>
<br/>
<p>Operational test: implement a minimal effective-parameter deformation that produces a shift ΔmW(σ,χ) in an electroweak-fit module and demand consistency with the ensemble of measurements. In this manuscript package I provide a notebook scaffold that demonstrates how to propagate a hypothetical ΔmW into a simple χ^2 constraint; a full electroweak-fit treatment is left as future work.</p>
<br/>
<h2>P.3 Lepton flavour universality ratios in rare B decays</h2>
<p>LFU ratios such as RK and RK* have historically shown tensions with SM expectations in certain kinematic regions, though the significance has evolved with new measurements. If SFST/QFIS effects are universal, they should not generate LFU violation; conversely, any sector-specific screening or coupling could in principle induce channel-dependent effects. I therefore use LFU ratios as a discriminant: models that explain Δaμ via SFST/QFIS-type couplings must remain consistent with current LFU constraints.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Box P.1: Minimal, reproducible constraint mapping (Δaμ) → effective coefficient</h2>
<p>I parameterize the leading SFST/QFIS contribution to a lepton magnetic moment as an effective dipole operator L_eff ⊃ (e/4mℓ) C_ℓ ℓ̄ σ^{μν} ℓ F_{μν}. At leading order this yields Δa_ℓ ≃ Re(C_ℓ). The SFST/QFIS matching proposed in Appendix O provides mvac=σχ from the low-frequency curvature of a retarded kernel; to connect to C_ℓ one must match the lepton–vacuum coupling structure. In this package I provide a conservative, model-agnostic bound by treating C_ℓ as a free effective coefficient and reporting the allowed magnitude range implied by Δaμ. A sector-specific microscopic matching (e.g. from Σ^R_ℓ(ω;T) at finite Unruh temperature) can then translate the bound into σ,χ priors.</p>

Instead, I include these observables to (i) motivate future matching work, (ii) provide conservative bounds on effective coefficients, and (iii) demonstrate how to integrate external constraints into the reproducibility pipeline. All numerical inputs and constraint calculations are fully scripted in the accompanying repository.</p>

<p>Stochastic Flux Saturation: A Consistent Effective Extension for Anomalous Mass–Energy Dynamics, Inertial Renormalization and Vacuum Rheology</p>
<br/>
<p>NEW33-QFIS Integrated Edition (Reviewer-Ready Version)</p>
<br/>
<p>Author: Martin W. Le Borgne</p>
<br/>
<p>This reviewer-ready integrated edition preserves the complete original NEW33 content and adds formal derivations, matching protocols, dimensional consistency checks, numerical insertion procedures, hyperbolicity clarifications, FRW reduction, and controlled Keldysh linear-response matching necessary to address reviewer-level concerns.</p>
<br/>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (QFIS at a glance — ½ page)</p>
<br/>
<p>SFST models the quantum vacuum as a stochastic–dissipative relativistic medium characterized by a scalar saturation field Φ and a transport current J^μ. Within this framework, Quantum Field Inertia Saturation (QFIS) provides a compact physical interpretation of inertia: inertial mass is not treated as a primitive substance, but as an emergent response coefficient of the vacuum to slow, low-frequency motion in the linear-response regime.</p>
<br/>
<p>Core statement (low-energy limit): in the IR limit (ω→0, k→0) the reactive part of the retarded vacuum response kernel generates a mass-like term, so that the equation of motion reduces to Newtonian dynamics F = m a with an effective inertial parameter</p>
<br/>
<p>m₀ = m_bare + m_vac , with m_vac ≡ σ χ .</p>
<br/>
<p>Here χ denotes the static vacuum susceptibility (how strongly Φ responds to an appropriate energy/source normalization in the static limit), while σ is the conversion coefficient that maps the vacuum response into an effective inertial contribution for the slow degree of freedom. In standard laboratory and astrophysical regimes, this reduces to an effectively constant m₀, preserving Lorentz invariance phenomenology and all tested low-energy dynamics; deviations, if any, are confined to extreme regimes and are treated as controlled EFT corrections.</p>
<br/>
<p>Technical additions in this reviewer-ready edition: (i) a controlled linear-response/Keldysh matching sketch for m₀=σχ including a regulator choice and uncertainty estimate; (ii) a non-double-counting insertion protocol for the TOV pipeline with automated guard tests; (iii) explicit units and configuration snippets; (iv) numerical acceptance criteria (residuals, convergence order, CFL, and physics tolerances) and sensitivity-run requirements; (v) an FRW reduction sketch to clarify the path toward H(z)/CMB fits.</p>

<p>Appendix O.1 — Controlled Matching for m₀ = σ χ</p>
<br/>
<p>Addendum to Appendix O.1 — Explicit 1-loop regularization sketch and uncertainty on ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0)</p>
<br/>
<p>Regularization strategy (minimal, reviewer-facing): The 1-loop integral entering ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) is UV-sensitive for generic spectra. I therefore adopt an explicit regulator and report the scheme dependence as an uncertainty band. Two standard choices are admissible and mutually cross-checking:</p>
<br/>
<p>(a) Pauli–Villars (PV): replace the propagator D(ω,k) by D_PV(ω,k)=D(ω,k)−D_M(ω,k) with a heavy regulator mass M≫ω0. Then ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) becomes finite and scales as ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0)=ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0)|finite + O(ω0^2/M^2).</p>
<br/>
<p>(b) Dimensional regularization (DimReg) with MS-bar: evaluate the k-integral in d=3−ε and absorb poles 1/ε into a local counterterm consistent with EFT power counting. The residual finite part defines the matched parameter σ at the renormalization scale μ.</p>
<br/>
<p>Error estimate: In both schemes, the remaining theoretical uncertainty can be parameterized as</p>
<br/>
<p>δΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0)/ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) ≈ max{ O(ω0^2/M^2), O(β_EFT) },</p>
<br/>
<p>where β_EFT denotes the expected size of higher-dimension operator contributions omitted at the working EFT order. Practically, I recommend scanning M (PV) or μ (DimReg) over one decade and quoting the envelope as a conservative matching uncertainty. This uncertainty propagates linearly to m_vac and thus to σ (holding χ fixed).</p>
<br/>
<p>Finite-temperature / finite-density note: if the vacuum sector is evaluated at finite T or chemical potential, the same regulator is applied and the IR limit is taken after Matsubara/Keldysh continuation. The leading correction is controlled by standard low-T expansions and can be included as an O(T^2/ω0^2) term in the matching uncertainty if needed.</p>

<p>Unit tests: (i) units and scaling of sigma_vac*chi_vac; (ii) parameter parsing of configs/sigma_chi_example.yaml; (iii) legacy flag coverage (legacy routines not executed when disabled); (iv) linearity and float64 stability of compute_vacuum_mass_density over 6 decades (rel. err &lt; 1e−12).</p>
<br/>
<p>Integration tests: run three canonical pipelines (A) baseline (sigma_vac=0), (B) legacy path, (C) sigma_chi path; verify: insertion only active when mode=&quot;sigma_chi&quot;; baseline deltas remain at numerical noise (&lt;1e−6 relative).</p>
<br/>
<p>Regression/numerics: residual ≤ 1e−8; CFL respected; convergence order ≈2; WFaktor stability &lt;20% under refinement.</p>
<br/>
<p>Physics acceptance: enforce ΔM_max, ΔR(1.4), ΔΛ thresholds as specified in Appendix O.3 addendum.</p>

<p>Appendix O.7 — Fully worked 1-loop example for ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) (reproducible PV + DimReg)</p>
<br/>
<p>Purpose: provide at least one explicit, reproducible 1-loop calculation of the low-frequency coefficient ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) in a minimal model, including a concrete regulator choice and numerical evaluation. This serves as an example/micro-check for the controlled matching protocol used to motivate m_vac ∝ ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) and thus m0 = m_bare + σ χ.</p>
<br/>
<p>Minimal model: a slow collective coordinate x(t) couples locally to a quantized scalar vacuum field φ(t,x) via L_int = g x(t) φ(t,0). In linear response, integrating out φ yields an effective kernel K_R(ω) whose ω² term defines an induced mass contribution.</p>
<br/>
<p>Retarded 1-loop self-energy (standard representation, after analytic continuation):</p>
<br/>
<p>ΣR(ω) = g² ∫ d³k/(2π)³ [ 1/(2 ω_k) ( 1/(ω − ω_k + i0⁺) − 1/(ω + ω_k + i0⁺) ) ], with ω_k = √(k² + m_φ²).</p>
<br/>
<p>Taking two derivatives and setting ω=0 gives (formal step):</p>
<br/>
<p>ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = g² ∫ d³k/(2π)³ 1/ω_k³ .</p>
<br/>
<p>The integral is UV divergent and must be regularized. Below I give two explicit examples: Pauli–Villars (PV) and dimensional regularization (DimReg).</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>A) Pauli–Villars example (PV)</p>
<br/>
<p>Define the PV-regulated integral by subtracting a heavy regulator mass M ≫ m_φ:</p>
<br/>
<p>I_PV(M) = (1/2π²) ∫₀^∞ dk k² [ (k²+m_φ²)^(-3/2) − (k²+M²)^(-3/2) ].</p>
<br/>
<p>Then ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0)_PV = g² I_PV(M). For large M the leading scaling is logarithmic: I_PV(M) ~ (1/2π²) ln(M/m_φ) + O(m_φ²/M²).</p>
<br/>
<p>Reproducible numeric evaluation (example inputs: g=1, m_φ=1):</p>
<br/>
<p>• M = 10: I_PV(M) = 1.16650324e-01 (abs.err ≈ 4.5e-14), ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = 1.16650324e-01</p>
<br/>
<p>• M = 100: I_PV(M) = 2.33300647e-01 (abs.err ≈ 4.5e-13), ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = 2.33300647e-01</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>B) Dimensional regularization example (DimReg, MS-bar)</p>
<br/>
<p>In d=3−ε spatial dimensions one finds a pole 1/ε plus a finite part. After MS-bar renormalization, the finite dependence is logarithmic in μ:</p>
<br/>
<p>I_MS(μ) = (1/2π²) ln(μ/m_φ) + const_MS (the constant is scheme-dependent and absorbed into σ(μ)).</p>
<br/>
<p>For a reproducible minimal example I set const_MS=0 (any other choice simply shifts σ by a constant counterterm). Example inputs: g=1, m_φ=1:</p>
<br/>
<p>• μ = 0.333333: I_MS(μ) = -5.56563487e-02, ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = -5.56563487e-02</p>
<br/>
<p>• μ = 1: I_MS(μ) = 0.00000000e+00, ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = 0.00000000e+00</p>
<br/>
<p>• μ = 3: I_MS(μ) = 5.56563487e-02, ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) = 5.56563487e-02</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Matching band (example): vary PV regulator over one decade M∈[10,100] (with m_φ=1). The resulting spread in ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) defines a conservative matching uncertainty δΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0) to be propagated into σ and then into observables. This band is explicitly computable from the table above and from regulator scans in the accompanying notebook.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Appendix O.8 — Quantitative uncertainty propagation (matching → σ → observables)</p>
<br/>
<p>Goal: make matching uncertainty operational by showing how regulator variation (M or μ) produces a spread in ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0), which maps to σ and then to ΔM_max, ΔR(1.4M⊙), ΔΛ(1.4) via finite-difference sensitivities measured in the TOV solver.</p>
<br/>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<br/>
<p>σ(R) = C_conv ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0;R) / χ (R denotes regulator scale, e.g. M or μ; C_conv is a convention factor).</p>
<br/>
<p>m_vac(R) = σ(R) χ = C_conv ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0;R). (Holding χ fixed, the matching uncertainty lives entirely in ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0;R).)</p>
<br/>
<p>Finite-difference sensitivities (to be measured numerically per EOS):</p>
<br/>
<p>S_M ≡ ∂(ΔM_max)/∂m_vac, S_R ≡ ∂(ΔR_1.4)/∂m_vac, S_Λ ≡ ∂(ΔΛ_1.4)/∂m_vac.</p>
<br/>
<p>Procedure (reproducible): run two sigma-chi insert cases with m_vac = m_vac,0 ± δm and estimate S ≈ [O(+δm)−O(−δm)]/(2δm).</p>
<br/>
<p>Illustrative example table (numbers below are placeholders to show the reporting format; replace with measured S values from your canonical runs A–C):</p>
<br/>
<p>Regulator R | ΣR&#x27;&#x27;(0;R) | σ(R) | m_vac(R) | ΔM_max(R) | ΔR_1.4(R) | ΔΛ_1.4(R)</p>
<br/>
<p>----------- | --------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------</p>
<br/>
<p>R = R_low | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...</p>
<br/>
<p>R = R_mid | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...</p>
<br/>
<p>R = R_high | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Recommended minimal quantitative example (for the manuscript): report a 10% change in σ at fixed χ and show the induced changes</p>
<br/>
<p>δ(ΔM_max) ≈ S_M · δm_vac, δ(ΔR_1.4) ≈ S_R · δm_vac, δ(ΔΛ_1.4) ≈ S_Λ · δm_vac,</p>
<br/>
<p>together with the measured S values for three EOS (Polytrop, SLy, APR). This turns matching uncertainty into an explicit error bar on the paper’s headline percentages.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Appendix O.9 — Hard non-double-counting guard (runtime assertion)</p>
<br/>
<p>To enforce the non-double-counting requirement at runtime (not only by documentation), implement a startup assertion in the TOV assembly stage:</p>
<br/>
<p>```python</p>
<br/>
<p>def validate_inertia_mode(cfg):</p>
<br/>
<p>mode = cfg[&#x27;inertia_insertion&#x27;][&#x27;mode&#x27;]</p>
<br/>
<p>legacy = bool(cfg[&#x27;inertia_insertion&#x27;].get(&#x27;legacy_inertia_flag&#x27;, False))</p>
<br/>
<p>if mode == &#x27;sigma_chi&#x27; and legacy:</p>
<br/>
<p>raise RuntimeError(&#x27;Configuration error: sigma_chi insertion and legacy inertia renorm cannot be enabled simultaneously.&#x27;)</p>
<br/>
<p>```</p>
<br/>
<p>Add a unit test that expects this failure (fast CI):</p>
<br/>
<p>```python</p>
<br/>
<p>import pytest</p>
<br/>
<p>def test_validate_inertia_mode_raises():</p>
<br/>
<p>cfg={&#x27;inertia_insertion&#x27;:{&#x27;mode&#x27;:&#x27;sigma_chi&#x27;,&#x27;legacy_inertia_flag&#x27;:True}}</p>
<br/>
<p>with pytest.raises(RuntimeError):</p>
<br/>
<p>validate_inertia_mode(cfg)</p>
<br/>
<p>```</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Appendix O.10 — Justification of numerical acceptance thresholds</p>
<br/>
<p>Residual threshold (≤1e−8): chosen so that Newton residuals fall well below truncation error of the second-order spatial discretization for the reported grids; in practice this keeps solver error subdominant to discretization error and ensures percent-level physical effects are not contaminated by solver non-convergence.</p>
<br/>
<p>CFL factor (≤0.5): standard conservative choice for explicit/semiexplicit stability in the time-dependent 1D reference tests; used to ensure no superluminal or unstable modes appear in the hyperbolic sector when scanning parameters.</p>
<br/>
<p>Physics acceptance bands (ΔM, ΔR, ΔΛ): anchored to the paper’s documented benchmark effects (≈6%, ≈2%, 10–12%) and widened to accommodate EOS dependence, screening models, and discretization error; the acceptance window is defined to be tighter than the signal size while still allowing known model-to-model variability.</p>
<br/>
<p>WFaktor stability (&lt;20%): selected as a practical convergence indicator for the diagnostic quantity W under grid refinement and boundary-condition variation; a tighter bound can be enforced once the final benchmark suite is fixed.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Appendix O.11 — Cosmology roadmap (Boltzmann-code integration outline)</p>
<br/>
<p>Objective: provide concrete steps to connect SFST/QFIS to H(z), CMB and LSS pipelines (CLASS/CAMB). This appendix is an implementation roadmap rather than a full fit.</p>
<br/>
<p>Background level (FRW):</p>
<br/>
<p>1) Add background variable Φ(t) governed by the homogeneous reduction of ∇_μ J^μ + ... = 0. In FRW, J^i=0 and the evolution reduces to a dissipative ODE for Φ(t).</p>
<br/>
<p>2) Modify the effective matter coupling through A(Φ): in the Einstein-frame background equations, include Φ-dependent rescaling of the matter sector or equivalently add an effective source term in the continuity equation.</p>
<br/>
<p>3) If using the inertial interpretation m0=σχ, treat m_eff as an internal EFT parameter that remains constant in the homogeneous background (to preserve standard cosmology) unless explicitly modeling early-universe changes.</p>
<br/>
<p>Perturbations (linear):</p>
<br/>
<p>4) Introduce δΦ(k,t) as a new perturbation variable with a diffusion/relaxation term (Cahn–Hilliard-like form) and a source term from δT (baryonic trace operator).</p>
<br/>
<p>5) Add δΦ contributions to the perturbed Einstein equations via δT_int (hyperstress + J terms). Implement as additional stress-energy components in the Boltzmann code.</p>
<br/>
<p>6) Ensure gauge consistency: implement in Newtonian or synchronous gauge with explicit gauge-transformation checks for δΦ.</p>
<br/>
<p>Code touchpoints (CLASS/CAMB):</p>
<br/>
<p>• CLASS: background.c (new background module), perturbations.c (new scalar dof and source terms), input.c (parameters: ΓΦ, σ, χ, screening priors).</p>
<br/>
<p>• CAMB: equations.f90 (background and perturbations), modules for new scalar field and coupling; add parameters to .ini parsing.</p>
<br/>
<p>Validation strategy:</p>
<br/>
<p>• Recovery tests: set ΓΦ→0 and A(Φ)→1 to recover ΛCDM outputs; verify CMB spectra and matter power match baseline within numerical tolerance.</p>
<br/>
<p>• Small-coupling tests: perturbative regime where δΦ effects are linear and can be cross-checked against analytic solutions of a damped diffusion equation.</p>
<br/>
<p>Deliverable for submission: provide a short technical note or repo branch with a minimal CLASS patch implementing Φ background + δΦ diffusion with a switch to disable all effects.</p>
