# D3 — Electroweak cross-sector comparison (W-mass)

## Input
CDF II vs SM:
\(\delta = (9.52\pm 1.39)\times 10^{-4}\) (see Appendix W-mass block).

## Use in this manuscript
This is **not** used to fit σ. It is presented only as an **order-of-magnitude** cross-sector coincidence test, with an explicitly stated heuristic geometric/form-factor caveat.

## Mandatory checks before quoting any “match”
- Do **not** claim equality; claim only “same order of magnitude”.
- State that a full QFT operator matching is deferred.
- Keep all quantitative electroweak comparisons outside headline results (Discussion/Supplement only).
