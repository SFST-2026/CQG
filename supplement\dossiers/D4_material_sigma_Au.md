# D4 — Material coupling estimate for Au (σ_Au)

## Rationale
σ_Au is estimated from a base QED coupling scale (α) renormalized by a material correction (DOS / d-band screening proxy), as documented in the manuscript.

## Status
This is an **estimate** (not a fit to superconducting data) and is used only to motivate expected σ magnitudes for condensed-matter analogies.

## Deliverables
- Manuscript section: “Material coupling estimate”
- Supplement mapping note: `SUPPLEMENT_SFST_QFIS_MAPPING.md`
