Run ID: AP4PPRead2009_B_legacy
Status: diagnostic dossier (standardized)
Reason: Legacy variant documented; excluded if epsratio exceeds threshold.
Metric: max epsratio = 0.07
Raw outputs: see outputs/ and plots/ entries for this run/EOS/variant (paths recorded in supplement index).
Note: epsratio_profile.csv is a diagnostic radial-shaped profile consistent with the recorded max epsratio; replace with solver-exported tov_profile.csv for physical profiles.
