Remediation attempts (policy):
- Triggered (at least one δ_total component > 50%).
- Suggested rerun settings: grid refinement n→2n; epsabs=epsrel=1e-12; max_iter=400; Newton damping ON.
- This repository snapshot records the exclusion decision because the toy Poly2 EOS produced non-physical/inconsistent Mmax and R1.4 deltas under the baseline discretization; see the audit index.

Disposition:
- I exclude this run from primary headline statistics (EXCLUDED) and retain it in the audit trail; a rerun under the remediation settings above is required before re-inclusion.
- See audit_index.csv/audit_trail.csv for machine-readable indexing of this decision.

Remediation note:
- The readers-recommended stabilization configuration is recorded for reproducibility: grid refinement n→2n, epsabs=epsrel=1e-12, max_iter=400, Newton damping on.
- In this snapshot, the existing refinement ladder already yields non-finite/unstable δ_total for Mmax and R1.4 (placeholder-large), so the run is treated as non-stabilized and excluded.
- Future compute runs should re-execute this case under the remediation configuration and update this file with the outcome.
