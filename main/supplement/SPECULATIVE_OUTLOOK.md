# Speculative Outlook (beyond scope; deferred)

This note collects broader conceptual interpretations of the SFST/QFIS mechanism (e.g. emergent-spacetime analogies, ontology of mass/time, and saturation limits beyond the perturbative regime). These viewpoints are **exploratory** and are **not used** to derive the quantitative neutron-star observables in the main manuscript.

## Emergent-spacetime fluid analogy
(…text intentionally concise; expand as needed…)

## Mass as an environment-dependent dressing
(…)

## Time as an effective update-rate constraint
(…)

## Saturation limits and compact objects
(…)

A focused follow-on manuscript could provide an action-level completion and dedicated phenomenology.
