# Cover Letter — Submission to *Classical and Quantum Gravity*

Dear Editors,

We submit our manuscript on **vacuum-induced inertial renormalization in neutron-star structure** and its **quantitative impact on GW- and NICER-relevant observables**.

**What is new in this revision (reader-focused):**
- **Reader-focused structure:** the main text is written for the CQG readership (theory, EOS set, modified TOV implementation, results and observational implications). Implementation and reproducibility details are consolidated into *Data & Code Availability* and the Supplement.
- **Automated provenance:** the submission snapshot is fully pinned with a reproducible record (Docker digest, archive ID, RNG seed, snapshot IDs) and a validated `plot_metadata.json`.
  - Docker digest (image used for the snapshot): `sha256:c18878630415a7e3598158d560cf7e615dba8967bdc8283472a610a7e362bedc`
  - Archive ID (snapshot SHA1; used as commit-equivalent identifier for this submission bundle): `5af6ad306d4708984415636bdf8b4a5fff1cb23b`
  - RNG seed: `123456`
  - Data snapshot: `data/snapshots/snapshot_c04378d8b099.tar.gz`
- **Numerical robustness:** Figure X provides a compact 3‑panel validation (convergence ladder, epsratio distribution, Richardson residual trace), with raw tables and plotting scripts in the repository.
- **EOS / prior sensitivity:** we include 2–3 representative EOS bracketing checks and narrow/wide prior comparisons in the Supplement, to demonstrate that headline shifts are not EOS artefacts.
- **Reweighting demonstrator:** a short, reproducible GW reweighting demo (GW170817) is included as a minimal end‑to‑end example of observational discriminability.

We believe the paper is well aligned with CQG’s scope: it proposes a clearly defined EFT matching prescription and evaluates its measurable consequences for neutron-star observables under controlled numerical uncertainty.

Sincerely,  
*The Authors*
