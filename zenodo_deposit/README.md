# Zenodo deposit plan (DOI)

we will create a Zenodo deposit for the exact repository snapshot (code + Supplement + outputs) used in the accepted version.

## Steps we follow
1. Create a new Zenodo upload from the tagged release `v*`.
2. Upload:
 - repository snapshot archive
 - outputs archive
 - SHA256SUMS.txt
 - Supplement_full.pdf
3. Set embargo if required by journal policy (or keep private until acceptance).
4. Record the minted DOI in PROVENANCE.md and in the manuscript.

## Current status
- DOI: TBD (will be minted from the tagged release)
